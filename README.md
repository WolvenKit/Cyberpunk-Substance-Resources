-------------------

## Running the Substance Designer Python script

1) Download the source code for this repository, or the *Cyberpunk SD Script.py* directly.
2) Run Substance Designer and open the Python Editor window. (Windows/Python Editor)
3) From within the Python Editor window, open the downloaded *Cyberpunk SD Script.py* file.
4) Use the Python Editor to edit the user input section at the beginning of the Python file. The base path and image format must be set for the script to function correctly. The script looks for mltemplate files exported to JSON, and raw format textures (.png, .tga, etc.). This directory should be prepared by using WolvenKit 8.7+.
5) Press the *Run* button. (looks like play icon)
